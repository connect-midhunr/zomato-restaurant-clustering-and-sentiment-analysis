In this project, I have attempted to analyze the metadata and reviews of popular restaurants in Hyderabad and build machine learning models to cluster the restaurants into different segments based on cuisines and analyze the sentiments of the reviews given by the customers. 

## :floppy_disk: Project Files Description</h2>

<p>This project contains an executable iPython Notebook, a presentation and source as follows:</p>
<h4>Executable Files:</h4>

  <li><b>Zomato_Restaurant_Clustering_and_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb</b> - Google Colab notebook containing data summary, exploration, visualisations, feature engineering, text processing, modelling, performance evaluation and conclusion.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Documentation:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Presentation PDF - Unsupervised Machine Learning - Zomato Restaurant Clustering and Sentiment Analysis - Capstone Project.pdf</b> - Presentation slideshow of the project.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Source Directory:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Data & Resources.zip</b> - Includes metadata and review data of restaurants listed by Zomato in Hyderabad.</li>
</ul>

## :book: Problem Statement

Zomato is an Indian restaurant aggregator and food delivery start-up founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah in 2008. Zomato provides information, menus, and user-reviews of restaurants, and also has food delivery options from partner restaurants in select cities.
The main objective is to understand the existing data and analyze their trends and patterns, so that machine learning models can be built, one for segmentation of restaurant types and another for sentiment analysis of reviews.

## :book: Approach

1.	Understanding the business task.
2.	Reading data from files given and providing a summary.
3.	Data cleaning, which involves removing irregularities in the data.
4.	Exploratory data analysis, to find which factors affect sales and how they affect it.
5.	Feature engineering, to prepare data for modelling.
6.	Text Processing, to convert text to numeric data for modelling.
7.	Modelling data (for both clustering and sentiment analysis) and comparing the models to find out the most suitable one for forecasting.
8.	Conclusion.

## :book: Exploratory Data Analysis

The following insights were gained from EDA:
<li>No e-mails of campaign type 1 got ignored.</li>
<li>If campaign type is 1, then the mail has 66% chance of getting read and 23% change of getting acknowledged.</li>
<li>Customer location or time of day does not affect the status of e-mail.</li>
<li>As the number of previous communication increases, the chances of the e-mail being read or acknowledged also increases.</li>
<li>E-mails tend to get ignored when word count is greater than 800.</li>

## ðŸ“˜: Conclusion

The following conclusions were drawn from Modelling:
<li>Oversampled data seems to be better than undersampled data. This can be due to the fact that undersampling causes loss of information.</li>
<li>The model built using XGBoost algorithm with SMOTE dataset performed better than the other models. It should be preferred for predicting mail statuses.</li>
<li>If model interpretability is more important than accuracy, model built using logistic regression algorithm and SMOTE dataset should be chosen over the one using XGBoost algorithm. It is the best performer among the white box models.</li>
